## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the creators of [OneDark-Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) for their incredible work and inspiration. This theme served as the foundation and motivation for creating Equinox, particularly in developing the light mode variant. OneDark-Pro's excellent color harmony and readability principles guided the development of both the light and dark versions of this theme.

The Equinox theme aims to capture the essence of what makes OneDark-Pro so beloved while extending that experience to users who prefer light themes or automatic theme switching.
